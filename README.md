**Cryptocurrrency And It's Future**

The popularity of cryptocurrencies increased in 2017 due to several consecutive months of clear growth in their market capitalization. Prices rose more than $ 800 billion in January 2018.
Although machine learning has been successful in predicting stock market prices using a number of different time series models, its use in digital currency price forecast has been relatively limited. The reason for this is obvious as the prices of cryptocurrencies depend on many factors such as technological advances, internal competition, pressure on delivery markets, economic problems, security issues, politics and more. Their high volatility leads to the great potential of high profit if intelligent strategies are taken for prediction. Unfortunately, due to their lack of indicators, cryptocurrencies are less reliable compared to traditional financial predictions like stock market speculation.
In the last few years, with the advent of blockchain technology, there has been a huge increase in the use of Cryptocurrencies. However, Cryptocurrency is not seen as an investment opportunity due to unusual market behavior and high price volatility. Many of the solutions reported in Cryptocurrencies price based books may not work in real-time price forecasts because of their determinant nature.
Motivated by the above-mentioned issues, we propose a stochastic neural network model for
Cryptocurrency price prediction. The proposed approach is based on the concept of random movement, which is widely used in financial markets to model stock prices. The proposed model attracts indirect randomization of the visual activity layer of neural networks to mimic market dynamics. In addition, a strategy for learning market response patterns is also included in the forecast model. We have trained Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The results show that the proposed model is superior compared to the deterministic models.

To solve this we have build a platform named as "Cryptocurrency And Its Future"
Platform provides deatils of cryptocurrency like bitcoin and ethereum and also it provides the predicted price of currency for net 150 days. 


We use RNN LSTM to build the prediction model.
Frameworks and librarirs are : 
# Pandas Numpy Matplotlib scikit-learn
# Tensorflow, Keras.
# Streamlit
# Pycharm
# jupyter Notebook
# Data Lore 

TO run the project follow below steps:
# create a virtual enviroment in pycharm
# open terminal in pycharm and download libraries in virtual environmet
pip install tensorflow 
pip install streamlit
pip install pandas 
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib

# After loading libraries in environment, go to the folder where virtua; environment is created and paste the images which are in the repository.
# Open terminal and pass command 
streamlit run main.py
# This will take few seconds and the web app gets automatically open in web browser.
# Note : Do not copy local host link and open it in MObile Phones.
